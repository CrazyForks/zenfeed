zenfeed: Empower RSS with AI, automatically filter, summarize, and push important information for you, say goodbye to information overload, and regain control of reading.

## Preface

RSS (Really Simple Syndication) was born in the Web 1.0 era to solve the problem of information fragmentation, allowing users to aggregate and track updates from multiple websites in one place without frequent visits. It pushes website updates in summary form to subscribers for quick information access.

However, with the rise of Web 2.0, social media, and algorithmic recommendations, RSS didn't become mainstream. The shutdown of Google Reader in 2013 was a landmark event. As Zhang Yiming pointed out at the time, RSS demands a lot from users: strong information filtering skills and self-discipline to manage feeds, otherwise it's easy to get overwhelmed by information noise. He believed that for most users, the easier "personalized recommendation" was a better solution, which later led to Toutiao and TikTok.

Algorithmic recommendations indeed lowered the bar for information acquisition, but their excessive catering to human weaknesses often leads to filter bubbles and addiction to entertainment. If you want to get truly valuable content from the information stream, you actually need stronger self-control to resist the algorithm's "feeding".

So, is pure RSS subscription the answer? Not necessarily. Information overload and filtering difficulties (information noise) remain pain points for RSS users.

Confucius advocated the doctrine of the mean in all things. Can we find a middle ground that combines the sense of control and high-quality sources from active RSS subscription with technological means to overcome its information overload drawbacks?

Try zenfeed! **AI + RSS** might be a better way to acquire information in this era. zenfeed aims to leverage AI capabilities to help you automatically filter and summarize the information you care about, allowing you to maintain Zen (calmness) amidst the Feed (information flood).

## Project Introduction

zenfeed is your intelligent information assistant. It automatically collects, filters, and summarizes news or topics you follow, then sends them to you. But we're not just building another "Toutiao"... ü§î

**For [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) Veterans** üöó
* zenfeed can be your AI-powered RSS reader (works with [zenfeed-web](https://github.com/glidea/zenfeed-web))
* An [MCP](https://mcp.so/) Server for [RSSHub](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub)
* A customizable, trusted RSS data source and an incredibly fast AI search engine
* Similar to [Feedly AI](https://feedly.com/ai)

**For Seekers of [WWZZ](https://www.wwzzai.com/) Alternatives** üîç
* zenfeed also offers [information tracking capabilities](https://github.com/glidea/zenfeed/blob/main/docs/config.md#schedule-configuration-schedules), emphasizing high-quality, customizable data sources.
* Think of it as an RSS-based, flexible, more PaaS-like version of [AI Chief Information Officer](https://github.com/TeamWiseFlow/wiseflow?tab=readme-ov-file).

**For Information Anxiety Sufferers (like me)** üòå
* "zenfeed" combines "zen" and "feed," signifying maintaining calm (zen) amidst the information flood (feed).
* If you feel anxious and tired from constantly checking information streams, it's because context switching costs more than you think and hinders entering a flow state. Try the briefing feature: receive a summary email at a fixed time each day covering the relevant period. This allows for a one-time, quick, comprehensive overview. Ah, a bit of a renaissance feel, isn't it? ‚ú®

**For Explorers of AI Content Processing** üî¨
* zenfeed features a custom mechanism for pipelining content processing, similar to Prometheus [Relabeling](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_config).
* Each piece of content is abstracted as a set of labels (e.g., title, source, body... are labels). At each node in the pipeline, you can process specific label values based on custom prompts (e.g., scoring, classifying, summarizing, filtering, adding new labels...). Subsequently, you can filter based on label queries, [route](https://github.com/glidea/zenfeed/blob/main/docs/config.md#notification-route-configuration-notifyroute-and-notifyroutesub_routes), and [display](https://github.com/glidea/zenfeed/blob/main/docs/config.md#notification-channel-email-configuration-notifychannelsemail)... See [Rewrite Rules](https://github.com/glidea/zenfeed/blob/main/docs/config.md#rewrite-rule-configuration-storagefeedrewrites).
* Crucially, you can flexibly orchestrate all this, giving zenfeed a strong tooling and personalization flavor. Welcome to integrate private data via the Push API and explore more possibilities.

## Installation and Usage

### 1. Installation

By default, uses SiliconFlow's Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (free) and Pro/BAAI/bge-m3. If you don't have a SiliconFlow account yet, use this [invitation link](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/i/U2VS0Q5A) to get a ¬•14 credit.

Support for other vendors or models is available; follow the instructions below.

#### Mac/Linux

```bash
curl -L -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glidea/zenfeed/main/docker-compose.yml

# If you need to customize more configuration parameters, directly edit docker-compose.yml#configs.zenfeed_config.content BEFORE running the command below.
# Configuration Docs: https://github.com/glidea/zenfeed/blob/main/docs/config.md
API_KEY=your_apikey TZ=your_local_IANA LANG=English  docker-compose -p zenfeed up -d
```

#### Windows
> Use PowerShell to execute
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glidea/zenfeed/main/docker-compose.yml" -OutFile ([System.IO.Path]::GetFileName("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glidea/zenfeed/main/docker-compose.yml"))
